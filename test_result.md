## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created backend with FastAPI
   - Created frontend with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS
   - Set up proper directory structure

2. **Backend Implementation**
   - FastAPI server with CORS enabled
   - DeepSeek API integration for PC build recommendations
   - Environment variables configuration
   - API endpoints:
     - `/api/generate-build` - Generate PC build recommendations
     - `/api/ask-ai` - Ask AI questions about PC components
     - `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

3. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Modern, responsive homepage with budget input and use-case selection
   - Build result page with markdown rendering and download functionality
   - Ask AI chat interface with session support
   - Blog page with SEO-optimized structure
   - Tailwind CSS styling with gradient backgrounds

4. **Key Features Implemented**
   - Budget input with multiple currency support
   - Use-case selection (gaming, streaming, editing, etc.)
   - AI-powered build recommendations
   - Chat interface for PC building questions
   - Download build as markdown
   - Share build on Twitter
   - Responsive design

### üîß Configuration Files Created
- `/app/backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `/app/backend/.env` - Environment variables with DeepSeek API key
- `/app/backend/server.py` - FastAPI backend application
- `/app/frontend/package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `/app/frontend/.env` - Frontend environment variables
- `/app/frontend/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `/app/supervisord.conf` - Supervisor configuration

### üéØ Next Steps Required
1. Start the services using supervisor
2. Test the DeepSeek API integration
3. Implement Amazon Product Advertising API integration
4. Test end-to-end functionality
5. Add proper error handling and loading states
6. Implement structured data parsing for build results
7. Add SEO metadata and structured data

### üìù Technical Notes
- Using DeepSeek API key: `sk-57f13737f4c4407bae3934828f0611f1`
- Backend runs on port 8001
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- MongoDB not currently used but configured for future expansion
- All API endpoints prefixed with `/api` for proper routing

### üß™ Testing Protocol
- Test backend endpoints first using testing agent
- Test frontend functionality after backend verification
- Verify DeepSeek API connectivity
- Test build generation workflow
- Test Ask AI chat functionality

## Current Status
‚úÖ Initial implementation complete
‚è≥ Ready for testing and refinement
üîÑ Next: Start services and test core functionality
