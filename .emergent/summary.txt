<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated a Next.js (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) project from scratch, establishing a functional MVP for a PC Builder AI application. Key challenges included recurring  errors requiring port clearing, persistent issues with  environment variable handling leading to frontend-backend communication failures, and intermittent rate limiting/response parsing complexities with the DeepSeek API via OpenRouter. The engineer meticulously debugged and resolved these, often through iterative fixes, direct API testing, and temporarily hardcoding URLs in the frontend. Most recently, the engineer implemented a dark theme, integrated the OpenRouter DeepSeek API, and began work on an AI-powered blog, addressing user feedback on AI response conciseness and UI animations. Despite the AI's confidence in fixes, the user consistently reported unresolved frontend errors, indicating a divergence between the AI's test environment and the user's accessible preview.

<product_requirements>
The PC Builder AI is envisioned as a minimalist web application, initially focusing on an MVP for PC building recommendations. Key requirements include:
-   **Core Functionality**: Recommend optimized PC builds based on user budget and use-case (gaming, streaming, editing, office), ensuring component compatibility and using actual product names (from Amazon/PCPartPicker).
-   **AI Integration**: Utilize DeepSeek model via OpenRouter API (initially DeepSeek-V2-R1, then DeepSeek-R1, settled on ) for build generation and an Ask AI chat. The AI should provide detailed, yet appropriately concise, responses.
-   **Monetization**: Affiliate links (Amazon) for recommended products, inserted automatically into AI output.
-   **User Experience**: Modern, minimalist UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Pages include HomePage (budget/use-case input), BuildResultPage (components list with prices/links), AskAIPage (chat interface), and BlogPage.
-   **SEO**: Next.js for SEO, structured data, friendly URLs. A recent shift towards AI-powered blog with programmatic SEO (AI-generated builds for price ranges, AI-generated articles on PC topics) was requested to reduce manual writing.
-   **Data Handling**: No user accounts or login; anonymous usage. API polling for data refresh (daily CRON job). No user data stored.
-   **Enhancements**: Dark theme UI. Download build as text file (changed from Markdown). Share build with website base link (changed from Twitter). Temporary chat memory and a Previous Builds section on Ask AI page. UI/UX animations for smooth transitions (e.g., build result appearance, loading animations).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Next.js**: Frontend framework for React applications, chosen for SEO benefits and static generation capabilities.
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework for the backend, handling API endpoints and AI model interactions.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and minimalist UI development.
-   **DeepSeek AI (OpenRouter)**: Large language model used for generating PC build recommendations and answering PC-related queries.
-   **Affiliate Links**: Mechanism for monetization by embedding Amazon product links with an affiliate tag.
-   **Supervisor**: Process control system used for managing and running frontend and backend services.
-   **Environment Variables**: Securely store API keys and sensitive information (e.g., , , , , ).
-   **Programmatic SEO**: Strategy to automatically generate SEO-optimized content, such as build gallery pages and comparison articles, using AI.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete AI Blog Frontend Integration**: The backend endpoints for AI blog generation (, ) have been added, but the frontend () still needs to be updated to consume these APIs and display the generated content.
-   **Consistent Preview Accessibility**: Despite multiple attempts by the AI engineer, the user consistently reports no preview available or localhost shows nothing. This fundamental accessibility issue needs a robust, final resolution.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on implementing the AI-powered blog feature. This involved:
1.  **Backend Updates**: Modifying  to:
    *   Add Pydantic models  and  for request validation.
    *   Re-add the  endpoint.
    *   Add new API endpoints for the AI blog:  and . These endpoints would leverage the DeepSeek model to generate blog content (e.g., articles on PC topics or builds for different price ranges) as per the user's request for programmatic SEO.
2.  **Restarting Backend**: The last action recorded (Chat Message 632) was  followed by , indicating the engineer was applying the backend changes.

The current state of the product is that the core PC Build Generation and Ask AI Chat functionalities are, from the AI's perspective (based on its internal tests and screenshots up to Chat 588), fully functional with the correct DeepSeek Chat model integration, dark theme, and UI/UX enhancements (animations, revised download/share, chat memory, build context). However, the user repeatedly reports that these functionalities are *still not working* for them on their preview environment and that  is inaccessible, despite the AI's repeated confirmations of functionality in its own environment. This indicates a critical discrepancy in environment or access that remains unresolved from the user's perspective, even as new features like the AI blog are being implemented on the backend.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue implementing the AI blog functionality by updating the frontend to display the content generated by the new backend endpoints.
